## Database Schema

The integration uses several custom database tables:

### Subscriptions Table (`{prefix}_mifeco_subscriptions`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE {prefix}_mifeco_subscriptions (
    id bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
    product_id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
    stripe_subscription_id varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    stripe_customer_id varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    plan_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    status varchar(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    trial_end datetime DEFAULT NULL,
    current_period_end datetime DEFAULT NULL,
    created_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    KEY user_id (user_id),
    KEY stripe_subscription_id (stripe_subscription_id)
);
```

### Orders Table (`{prefix}_mifeco_orders`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE {prefix}_mifeco_orders (
    id bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id bigint(20),
    product_id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
    product_type varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    amount decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
    stripe_customer_id varchar(100),
    stripe_charge_id varchar(100),
    status varchar(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    KEY user_id (user_id),
    KEY stripe_charge_id (stripe_charge_id)
);
```

### Products Table (`{prefix}_mifeco_products`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE {prefix}_mifeco_products (
    id bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    description text,
    monthly_price decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
    annual_price decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
    features text,
    stripe_product_id varchar(100),
    stripe_monthly_price_id varchar(100),
    stripe_annual_price_id varchar(100),
    created_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

```

Additionally, user metadata is used to store information like:

3. **Payment**: User enters payment details in Stripe Checkout
4. **Confirmation**: User receives confirmation and is redirected back to site
5. **Access**: User immediately gains access to subscribed features

### Consulting Payment Flow

1. **Service Selection**: User browses consulting services
2. **Purchase**: User selects service and clicks purchase
3. **Payment**: User enters payment details in Stripe Checkout
